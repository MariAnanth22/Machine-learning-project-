Servo Performance Prediction using Linear Regression

  Project Description
This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict servo motor performance based on mechanical inputs. Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab
  Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Features: motor, screw, pgain, vgain
- Target: response (performance)

how to run
1. Download the `.ipynb` file
2. Open it in **Google Colab**
3. Run all cells to see the output

result
The Linear Regression model predicts servo response with good accuracy (e.g., R² score ≈ 0.90)
